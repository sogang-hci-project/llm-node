The course is capped at 15-20 students. Students self-select for the .5 credit course and meet for two hours each week for the duration of the semester. Topics in the course include time management, motivation, goal setting, self-regulation of emotions, social environment, study environment, learning and memory, and more.\n\nAs a librarian teaching the course, Kayla includes a research and libraries component.
