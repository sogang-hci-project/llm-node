# VTS session

UNIV135 Academic Excellence Seminar, is a course designed to help students explore their academic inhibitions-- what may be holding them back from academic success. The course is capped at 15-20 students. Students self-select for the .5 credit course and meet for two hours each week for the duration of the semester. Topics in the course include time management, motivation, goal setting, self-regulation of emotions, social environment, study environment, learning and memory, and more.

As a librarian teaching the course, Kayla includes a research and libraries component. Visual Thinking Strategies fit well with the unit on research, as well as the study environment. Unless the students are Art/Art History majors, they often overlook the galleries or the Peeler Art Center as a place of inspiration or study. Visual Thinking Strategies can help give students an introduction to the galleries space, as well as a reason to return.

# 3 steps

A VTS session works by asking three key questions and eliciting your answers. The questions are

1. What are you looking at right now?
2. why did you make that judgment?
3. What else do you see?
